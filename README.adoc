NOTE: You can now check the Actions to watch/check the status of the deployment.  

==== Actions

Running Deploy workflow will automatically kick off.

. Perform AWS IPI 
. Creates an Artifact for Destroy
.. You can download artifact if needed from GitHub Actions > Runs
.. Double check your retention period for Artifacts
. Setup HTPasswd IDP
.. Uses CLUSTER_ADMIN and ADMIN_PASS
.. Uses DEV_PASS for andrew the developer
. Install GitOps Operator
.. Sets admin password for console to ADMIN_PASS
. Adds MachineSet for infra nodes

On completion of Deploy workflow, the GitOps-Tasks workflow will automatically start.

. Creates argoCD applications from r3dact3d/gitops/main/blinker19/cluster.yaml

==== Important

* During the *deploy* workflow the artifacts describing the AWS resources that are deployed are needed for the *destroy* workflow.  
* The artifacts are uploaded for only 90 days and will need to be *manually* downloaded if it's not planned to *destroy* the cluster within that retention period.

=== To destroy OCP4.x

. Click below Destroy button to use last saved artifact to destroy Openshift cluster and infra resources.

This will kick off the destroy workflow, pulling the artifact from deploy workflow automatically and destroying the AWS resources.

== TODO

* Add OCP openshift-installer version as variable




NOTE: GitHub IDP is disabled currently

=== GitHub IDP

* GitHub IDP is used in this deploy, so a GitHub organization should be created
* Add the clientSecret to GitHub Secrets as CLIENT_SECRET
* Update the GitHub Organization name and clientID in idp-oauth.yaml file
